 Introductory Tutorial of Python
In the "Intro.py" you will find all the basics of Python.
In order to execute the code and to understand the working of the code, copy each section from the "Intro.py" seperately and paste it to another file which is "test.py" to test and check the working of the particular code.
While "convertermodule.py" is a module, you can see the 23rd section which is about Modules to better understand about the working of modules.
Last, we have a text file called "mybio.txt". You can see the 27th section of "Intro.py" to understand the File I/O.
